> **An AI-powered Emergency Room Matching System** connecting paramedics to the nearest available hospital in seconds.


## üö® The Problem: Critical Minutes Lost During Emergencies

During medical emergencies, **every second counts**. The "golden hour" - the critical time window immediately following a traumatic injury - is essential for patient survival. However, this precious time is often wasted when:

- Paramedics must **manually call multiple hospitals** to find an available emergency room
- Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) spend **valuable minutes on administrative tasks** instead of patient care
- Hospital selection is based on incomplete information, leading to **inefficient patient routing**
- **Communication delays** between ambulances and hospiatals create unnecessary wait times

These inefficiencies can mean the difference between life and death for critically injured patients.

## üí° Our Solution: MediCall

MediCall revolutionizes emergency response by creating a direct, AI-powered connection between paramedics and available emergency rooms. The system:

- Allows paramedics to **quickly input patient condition and location data**
- Uses **Gemini AI to analyze patient information** and identify suitable hospitals
- **Automatically contacts multiple hospitals simultaneously** using Twilio API
- Collects **real-time availability data** through automated voice response systems
- **Recommends the optimal hospital** based on availability, proximity, and compatibility with the patient's condition
- Provides **turn-by-turn navigation guidance** to the selected facility



The result: **Hospital matching in under 1 minute**, 5x faster than traditional methods, with 100% secure patient data handling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Chat-based Interface**: Quickly enter patient condition and location
- **Gemini AI**: Analyzes patient information, recommends suitable hospitals
- **Twilio API**: Parallel automated hospital calls IVR (1: Accept / 2: Reject via dial-tone)
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Delivers automated voice messages to hospitals
- **Mapbox Navigation**: Provides accurate, real-time route guidance
- **Material Design**: Intuitive UI aligned with Google's Material Design
- **EMT Verification**: Exclusive secure access for verified paramedics

### Differentiation from Existing Solutions

- Traditional methods rely heavily on **manual phone calls** or centralized emergency medical centers to verify hospital availability, leading to significant delays
- MediCall uniquely integrates Gemini AI and IVR API to **automatically and simultaneously contact multiple hospitals**, collect real-time responses, and instantly recommend the optimal hospital
- This greatly reduces the administrative workload for paramedics and helps preserve the critical golden hour for patients
