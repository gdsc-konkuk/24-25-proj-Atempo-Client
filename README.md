# MediCall

> **An AI-powered Emergency Room Matching System** connecting emergency patients to the nearest available hospital in seconds.

---

## üöë Project Overview

During emergency transport, critical time is often lost when paramedics must manually contact hospitals to find an available bed. **MediCall** streamlines this process by allowing paramedics to input patient details and location, after which **AI simultaneously contacts multiple hospitals**, recommending the first hospital that confirms availability. This approach ensures swift decision-making, protecting the vital "golden hour" for emergency treatment.
