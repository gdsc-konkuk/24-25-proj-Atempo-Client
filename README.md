# MediCall

> An AI-based Emergency Room Matching System that connects emergency patients to the hospital that can admit them the fastest.

---

## 🚑 Project Overview

During patient transport, issues arise when hospitals cannot admit patients or lack available medical staff, causing a loss of the critical "golden time".  
**MediCall** allows paramedics to simply input patient condition and location; then, **AI simultaneously contacts nearby hospital emergency rooms** to  
**automatically recommend the first available hospital that responds**.

## 🛠 Key Features

- **Chat-based interface** for easy patient information entry
- **Gemini AI** for hospital candidate selection and message generation
- **Parallel calls using Twilio** → hospitals respond via dial (1: Accept / 2: Reject)
- **Optimal matching based on response speed and distance**
- **Real-time route guidance** via Google Maps API

## 🧩 System Architecture

```plaintext
[Paramedics - Flutter App] 
  → Send patient condition and location
       ↓
[Server - Gemini AI] 
  → Select hospital list and generate guidance message
       ↓
[Twilio] 
  → Parallel calls; hospital responds with dial (1: Accept / 2: Reject)
       ↓
[Analyze response results + calculate distance]
       ↓
[Final hospital recommendation + Google Maps route guidance]
